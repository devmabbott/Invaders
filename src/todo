-Remove game_state_get_width()(height) calls and just define them (or maybe extern them)
-Implement some unit tests

ALIENS (simple for now, can make more advanced later)
------
Have them appear on the screen in rows
Have them move together
Have each individual one fire randomly

After aliens---

LEVELS
------
Loads one level at a time
Doesn't load next level until all badies are dead (or whatever conditions)
In charge of spawning and tracking aliens

NOW
-Need to pass the correct gun to ship_init
-Create another gun object that fires downwards for aliens
-New alien sprite
