Current Development (sprint)
----------------------------
    Let the player move his 'ship' around the game board
        -Create some sort of game state object seperate from the other stuff
            -Currently this should just have the position of the players ship. Every
             time through the game loop if an arrow key is pressed it should update
             the players position on the game state, and the draw function should
             draw everything that has changed in the game state
            -Ship object
        -Figure out how many times game should update a second for smooth gameplay
